# ADHD-DETECTION-USING-SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS
### ADHD Detection Research Project

#### Introduction:
This repository contains the code and documentation for a research project focused on developing a machine learning model for detecting Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) through sentiment analysis of textual data.

#### Abstract:
ADHD is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder impacting individuals across all age groups. Accurate diagnosis is challenging due to subtle symptoms and subjective assessments. This project aims to enhance traditional diagnostic methods by developing a machine learning model using sentiment analysis from various textual sources.

#### Methodology:
- **Data Acquisition:** Scraped data from Reddit's ADHD community for training the model.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and processed textual data, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and TF-IDF.
- **Model Architecture & Training:** Utilized SVM and Gaussian NB classifiers, boosting ensemble, and voting ensemble techniques for sentiment-based ADHD detection.

#### Evaluation:
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Achieved promising results with around 95% accuracy and 93% precision.

#### Result:
Demonstrated the potential of sentiment analysis as a tool for ADHD detection. Compared model performance with existing works, showcasing competitive accuracy and precision.

#### Future Work:
- Explore multimodal fusion of MRI/EEG-based models with questionnaire-based models.
- Investigate deep learning techniques for improved accuracy.
- Address ethical considerations and limitations of AI-based diagnosis.

#### Repository Structure:
- **data:** Contains dataset used for training and testing.
- **code:** Includes Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **documentation:** Holds detailed documentation of the project, including research paper, README, and references.
